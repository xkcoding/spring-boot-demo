## Introduction

`spring boot demo` is a project for learning and practicing `spring boot`, including `66` demos, and `55` of them have been done.

This project has integrated actuator (`monitoring`), admin (`visual monitoring`), logback (`log`), aopLog (`recording web request logs through AOP`), global exception handling (`json level and page level` ), freemarker (`template engine`), thymeleaf (`template engine`), Beetl (`template engine`), Enjoy (`template engine`), JdbcTemplate (`general JDBC operate database`), JPA (`powerful ORM framework `), mybatis (`powerful ORM framework`), Generic Mapper (`mybatis quick operation `), PageHelper (`powerful mybatis pagination plugin`), mybatis-plus (`mybatis quick operation`), BeetlSQL (`powerful ORM framework `), upload (`local file upload and qiniu cloud file upload`), redis (`cache`), ehcache (`cache`), email (`send various types of mail`), task (`basic scheduled tasks`), quartz (`dynamic management scheduled tasks`), xxl-job (`distributed scheduled tasks`), swagger (`API interface management and tests`), security (`RBAC-based Dynamic Rights Authentication`), SpringSession (`session sharing`), Zookeeper (`implement distributed locks by AOP`), RabbitMQ (`message queue`), Kafka (`message queue`), websocket (` server pushes the monitoring server status to front end `), socket.io (`chat room`), ureport2 (`Chinese-style report`), packaged into a `war` file, integrate ElasticSearch (`basic operations and advanced queries`), Async ( `asynchronous tasks`), integrated Dubbo (`with official starter`), MongoDB (`document database`), neo4j (`graph database`), docker (`container`), `JPA Multi-Datasource`, `Mybatis Multi-Datasource`, `code generator`', GrayLog (`log collection`), JustAuth (`third-party login`), LDAP(`CURD`), `Dynamically add/switch datasources`, Standalone RateLimiting(`AOP + Guava RateLimiter`), Distributed Ratelimiting(`AOP + Redis + Lua`), ElasticSearch 7.x(`use official Rest High Level Client`), HTTPS, Flyway(`initialize databases`),UReport2(`Chinese complex report `).

> If you have demos to contribute or needs to meet, it is very welcome to submit a [issue](https://github.com/xkcoding/spring-boot-demo/issues/new) and I will add it to my [TODO](./TODO.en.md) list.

## Branch Introduction

- branch master: Based on Spring Boot version `2.1.0.RELEASE`. Every module's parent dependency is the pom.xml at root directory in convenience of managing common dependencies and learning spring boot.
- branch v-1.5.x: Based on Spring Boot version `1.5.8.RELEASE`. Every module's parent dependency is spring-boot-demo-parent. But since the feedback shows that it is not much friendly to many new learners, this branch will not be mantained any more. All of the demos will be moved to branch master. Everyone could still study at this branch but it's suggested to study at branch master while Spring Boot has much new content over version `2.x`.

## Environment

- **JDK 1.8 +**
- **Maven 3.5 +**
- **IntelliJ IDEA ULTIMATE 2018.2 +** (*Note: Please use IDEA and make sure plugin `lombok` installed.*)
- **Mysql 5.7 +** (*Please use version 5.7 or higher because mysql has some new features and is not backward compatible at version 5.7. Althought this project will try to avoid this incompatibility*)

## Getting Started

> Note: If you has been forked this project, need to sync the project's code, please see: https://xkcoding.com/2018/09/18/how-to-update-the-fork-project.html

1. `git clone https://github.com/xkcoding/spring-boot-demo.git`
2. Open the cloned project in IDEA
3. Import the `pom.xml` file from the root directory using `Maven Projects` panel
4. If you can not find `Maven Projects` panel, try to tick `View -> Tool Buttons` on and the `Maven Projects` panel will appear on the right side of IDEA.
5. Find each Application class to run each module.
6. **`Note: Each demo has a detailed README file. Remember to check it before running the demo~`**
7. **`Note: In some condition you have to execute sql to prepare data before running demo, don't forget it~`**
